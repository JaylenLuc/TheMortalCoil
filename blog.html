                <p> For the fuck of it, imma try to argue that "free will" in its purest form does not exist. It is merely incidental, motivations which are
                    the drivers of free will are incidental, and that all actions of ostensible free will are the only possible action,
                    you "will" only one definite thing and none other. 
                    liberum arbitrium indiff erentiae is a latin term that explicates the idea of "Free Will" in the idealistic, unadulterated sense
                    both assumed in the metaphysical and phenomonological form. We think of free will as the power of choice, the agency to make 
                    conscious and emphatically autonomous decisions. The power of choice is the power to determine a phenomological outcome, through
                    the control of your metaphysical form. However, I believe the pure indifferent arbitrary liberty in the strictly metaphysical sense
                    does not exist and cannot exist. So heres the logical control flow (premise &lt===> warrant (includes link between the claim or
                    conclusion and the premise) &lt===> intermediate conclusion ==> main conclusion). The premise is that the crux of human free will 
                    is predicated on motivation, the capacity for choice. Motives can be caused by extenral stimuli that passes through the knowing mind
                    and/or by abstract concepts and the will to think thoughts. Motivation is simply a game of incidental weighing of many abtract Motives.
                    The Strongest one prevails given the circumstance. In this case, humans are not entirely confined to the present objects causation. But
                    Arthur Schopenhauer posited "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can will only one definite thing and absolutely
                    nothing other than that one thing." If you were to have made a decision that was different, you yourself, your character, must be entirely different which
                    is a rediculous hypothetical. "[M]an does at all times only what he wills, and yet he does this necessarily. But this is because he already is what he wills.".
                    We try try hard to believe in transcendental will as the thing-in-itself because it feels liberating. It is the inner essence of the self aware being. This "will"
                    does exist, but this "free will" is determined by motivations. If water could speak, it may will itself to flow down an estuary, or flow down a cavern. It can will
                    this, but there must be a causation, a motive for this to happen. Every action is preceded by a "will", but this "will" is only rendered active by a motive. And are these
                    motives absolutely arbitrated by us? Our conscious brains are just catching up to what our unconscious brains wer already doing, willing, motivating. it is scary. But we
                    hold on to this transcendental "will", because it is comfortable, because we like knowing, we like control. Just take the Standford Prison experiment done by
                    Phillip Zimbardo which to his construction of his Theory The Lucifer Effect which consists of :  Mindlessly taking the first small step. -> Dehumanization of others.
                    ->De-individuation of self (anonymity)
                    ->Diffusion of personal responsibility.
                    ->Blind obedience to authority.
                    ->Uncritical conformity to group norms.
                    ->Passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference. All this is done without conscious knowledge by humans. Humans blindly conforming to an evil system, rendering
                    us complacent to committing evil acts with impunity and with no remorse. If we have free will we must be judged by our motives that motivate our will to render an action, what
                    where the motives of these other wise "good" people in the observed world. These motives were unconcious, inborn, and constant! The proxy for free will is taking
                    responsibility for ones actions, can you hold someone accountable for unconcious acts? Therefore there is no moral freedom, and thus can there really be responsibility
                    assigned? One indicator for free will is accountability for ones actions, responsibility, and awareness. This is because we live under the assumption that motives 
                    are chosen by our will and our will wills this motive. But can we really say there is accountability there? (see "voodoo doll experiment") "In effect, the unconscious brain proposes and the mind disposes."
                    Our conscious minds only has the power to veto the policies and proposals of the unconcious mind. Can we really call that free will if we cannot consiously determine what we will
                    and what motivates action? We can supress and control, but acts of proscription is an indication of a hasty and frantic attempt to control the uncontrollable.

                <a id="climbing"><h2 style="text-align:center">Rock Climbing and exploring Urbano</h2></a>
                <p>Being able to monkey around urban apparatuses confers a special quality of liberty and wakefullness. I feel more in tune with my environment
                    and my body. I think this is engendered by the fact that with the ability to be able to climb, my physical footprint (and handprint so to speak)
                    is expanded and the world seems so accessible to me. I see urbano around me and it doesnt look so scary anymore, I can father this structure, I can 
                    interact with the building interface and move by body without fear. The freedom to move where ever i want is exhilerating and liberating. Becuase the closer
                    you get to a stright line is the shortest path to your destination. I can see urbano and it not be an impediment to me but an enabler, because I am now 
                    an agent of my own destiny! The ability to navigate our surroundings is an important skill. Places that once were designed for regular use, that have fallen
                    from vitality, now abandoned and subject to the whims of unregulated human behavior, and the whims of unvetoed natural forces is one kind of 
                    urbano mileu, a surrounding, a space in time that I enjoy. It gives me the same thrill and simultaneous peace as climbing, and many times you need
                    to climb to access these places. I feel free, free from my own suffering that I created or maybe not. The tranquil chaos is how i describe it.
                    When my mind is in a mess, i search for places that match my energy but provide an equal but opposite attracting force. Its dangerous, scary, but
                    I can escape because I "will" it and for a mutlitude of reasons that "will" is motivated by forces in my mind i cannot control. is it the "will" that 
                    creates the motive or the motive that creates the will or is it that the "will" always exists but awaits contigently and incidentally for a motive to 
                    strike it !!!!!???? I hate myself and I sometimes love myself, I have this churning knot in my stoamch and I cease to be "doing", but when I am in These
                    places, I feel like I have achieved escpae velocity of my mind. AHHHHHH. In this way, I feel liberated and in tune with me, like when I climb. My life is 
                    at risk, and I Love it. Buildings like these are in the limbo of anthropogenic urbano, and it stimulates me, when my mind is desperate I see these 
                    places reach a parity with me .

                <a id="winetasting"><h2 style="text-align:center">Orange Gold and Gulfi Nerojbleo</h2></a>
                <p>like a child in a candy store, me and my friend yacob strolled through the winery -- The Original Winery mind you (all wineries have awsome employee polos for some reason. and yes 
                    "for some reason" because every thing has a reason. However, they never sell them to customers, kind of a missed bussiness oppourtunity) excited but tired after going rock climbing And
                    bouldering (where I finally got my belaying certification). We eventually came out with 4 wines in total, two of which i purchased and the same two I will express my thoughts on.
                    So i popped open the orange wine. Orange wines are the biracial kind of wine, they are made from the white grape variant called pinot grigio of the species Vitis vinifera which is 
                    taxonomically lower in its specificity than species. The process involves the use of keeping both the seeds and skin, a decision usually taken when making red wine. The taste is interesting: 
                    its very dry and acidic and almost tastes like a suagry soda drink wtih some vodka poured into it. meh meh.  Gulfi Nerojbleo is a red wine from Sicily, Italy. It's made from Nero d'Avola grapes
                    which is full bodied, jammy fruit, and sweet tannins. Nero d'Avola is a dry wine with lower acidity and considered the "the most important red wine grape in Sicily". What I taste is a very
                    full bodied, peppery falvour, and a bit dry. And I might say that there are even hints of fruit in the falvour finerprint as well. Almost as if im back in seattle picking berries off old dilapitated 
                    walkways, abandoned urbano of all kinds, and a rustic busheries near a nice stream which may be contaminated by brewery effluent leading to a depletion of oxygen in the water, and increased
                    sodium concentrations. It tastes good. Life is Good, but I make my life Bad somehow, its the will, its the Representation... So It Goes i guess....

                <a id="albumreview1"><h2 style="text-align:center">Album review: the now now and never by what is your name?</h2></a>
                <p>
                    <p><img class= "center" src="pictures\nonow.jpg" alt="girlfriend" style="width:30%" onclick="window.open('pictures\\nonow.jpg', '_blank')">
                    It seems like this artist is a self made, individual producer that takes samples and sounds and composes sonic collages. Its a certain vibe that even they can’t describe. Started off 
                    With break core, they now have walked into a path that is more revitalizing. I do not know what to call this new sound scape.Perhaps plunder phonics? But that term is a bit radical and pejorative, perhaps
                    a sound collage with a synthesis of indietroncis, post rock, breakcore, shoe gaze, shoe gazing, gazing at a shoe, and a whole lot of awesome!
                    I came across a very comforting and refreshing artist when a friend decided to send me a song from an artist anointed the name ‘what is your name?’ even
                    Suffixed with a question mark as if it is asking you for you name? The music wants to know who you are, wrap its sonic vibrations around you and comfort you unconditionally.
                    I find that these songs define a subset of human emotion that I was trying to find, a certain sound I was try to hear. I want it but I can never find it, a warmth and reprieve 
                    I need in my life whether I deserve it or not. It defines this very sentimental, emotive, bitter sweet whimsical happiness. Listening to this album feels like I am rediscovering 
                    my childlike Wonder, rediscovering the word that is within my own headspace and as a result seeing the world in a light that is a little bit different, almost a different hue. I 
                    feel Melancholic, I got the Morbs. These type of songs and music are hard to describe, it just feels like stepping back into your childhood room, surrounded by color, cultural curio, 
                    memories. It gives me a similar feeling to when I listen to passion pit, you step into a world of calm. My visceral unconscious brain likes to take my cognitive conscious self for a little walk.
                    Sometimes it kidnaps my conscious self and my consciousness has to play a very frantic and stressful catch up game with my unconscious essence.
                    But with these songs, my unconscious self is pleasant, not amicable or philanthropic, just simply behaving in a way that I trust and treading the roads in a consistent way. It takes me to a
                    place that I like this time, unlike other times. It takes me to a place, a road, maybe leading nowhere. It is Dusk, the suns light was just hidden under the horizon, only some of its vigor is left
                    creating a dark blue hue that engulfs the sky. It takes me across this road, and its warm. I might be by myself? I am walking, with no purpose, no reason, just warmth, but with a little bit of desperation,
                    the source of which is the very thing that took me to this place. What a life! As the mortal coil unwinds, we cannot do anything about it, so maybe… let the wind carry us. I am moving, I am crying and I
                        am morb bombed. So it goes. This album is a strata of the human condition that deals with desperation mixed with morbination and depression and melancholia. You want to die but you don’t, you feel,
                        YOU FEEL! You realize that often times, the fundamental principles of sufficient reasoning and lack of free will makes you ill, weak, sick with disease. From the depths of you unconscious it strangles 
                        you, expect you don’t die, you are dead but you are alive and you are condemned to live like this, suffering everyday, wanting to get out of your cage. And you realize that, as stoics would posit, you
                        create much of you suffering, as much or even more than external vicissitudes , and you create situations and emotive cages from your own brain, alot of the times you cannot control and alot of the
                        time is a positive feedback loop that is necessitated from your inner darkest subconscious. EVIL and CRUEL THIS IS CRUELLLLLLLL!!!!!!!

                    Anyways I like this album, makes me feel…. But I just let it carry me.

                    I give this album 2 and half full leaf sheeps

                <p>
                as long as we are humans with fragile bodies, streaming minds, and a yearning for love, romance, meaning , purpose, as long as there is a mysterious spontaneous universe, and as long as there is this cruel, unforgiving , unloving, meaningless, 
                purposeless and self directed world, I will be eternally feeling worthless , confused, confusing, angry, and ineffably miserable. It’s quite absurd. Absurdist . Like the word absurdist boy pussy. I like that word. Worldly responsibilities hold an 
                iron fist around these spirits of ours . We often structure our thoughts around a world we want, not the world as a noumenon. There’s a gulf of execution, gulf of evaluation that drives me to the brink of wanted to leave this world. Maybe doing 
                things like this would give me a small inlet for my mind to enjoy some peace, some joy. But the tides keep flowing . I stand alone, alone in my own life. This is my way of expressing what I find somewhat peaceful . No more and no less.
                 Whether I start to over intellectualize a trivial hobby is a question for the future. Go to a secluded area by myself, smoke some weed, and maybe I’ll be more detached from egoist and emotional resistances , pressures. Maybe I’ll feel better. Maybe I’ll love myself.

                    Preface: At first this entry was going to be just about my friend Bob, but I interjected it with other things I was Feeling, so it’ll just be a free style impromptu journal entry that has no particular direction but a lot of flavor.
                    <br><br>
                    My dear friend bob. One and a trillion chance you will be born from conception just to be named bob haha. I’m kidding, love you bob. Everytime I feel like a certain kind of languish and lassitude , 
                    I hit this boy up and we end up having the best most intellectually stimulating conversations. It makes me think that a person like me needs someone by my side to be ready just to listen and engage with me. 
                    I feel energized when I converse with him, because I get this child like wonder I felt like I was temporarily missing up until that point. We could talking about anything from urban planning, roadway traffic analysis, 
                    neo platonic monism, and just recently about how it’s strange how the same very primitive human brain can create a society has moved past and beyond certain primal needs of human beings. Recently I went bouldering, 
                    I got tired very easily and rather quickly which sucked and I was dissatisfied that I couldn’t go any further, but now everytime I laugh my entire upper body hurts. Anyways, I always enjoy my time with bob, I want to
                    keep learning, exposing myself to new ideas and thoughts and feelings I thought never existed, I want to keep reading so I can keep having these conversations with him. They really keep me going, it’s these interactions 
                    that keep me loving my life at certain points. At times I think I will never meet a person like him, but then again, will I ever meet anyone like everyone I know? Everyone is so unique, whether I enjoy my time with them or not. 
                    I feel so bad I hurt my girlfriend, I feel like if things were to end soon, I will never find anyone like her ever again, someone that is so idiosyncratic and pulchritudinous. She becomes more beautiful and impressive the more
                    I know her and spend time with her, she just becomes so much more like an individual I want to spend my life with. Currently she’s my betrothed wife but I want to take care of her and love her, and make her experience the joys in life.
                    I hurt her many times because of thought processes that spiral me into uncontrollably draconian moods, I wish I never become that persons ever again. Certain images in my head come to mind that destroy me but also reassure me,
                        I need to love her and care for her. I want to make her proud, and I want her to be safe and achieve Happy (not a typo). Because there’s a difference between the state of Happy and the feeling of joy. Happy is a consistent and
                        reliable baseline, a state of being and existing and thinking. Happy is achieved through hard introspection and self development, and a hard rewriting of your thinking and feeling processes which may be near impossible if
                        you are Me. You will experience turbulence but you will rebound to the Happy. You will spread this warmth and passion to the world. It is consistency, an internal state that creates a sense of security that makes you an 
                        individual agent that is almost seperate from its environment but learns to Accept and understand their lot, not create defense mechanism to create a false sense of joy and therefore boost their own ego at the expense of
                        their own long term mental health and the so called ontological truth which is the subjective conclusion a critically thinking individual would conclude and not simply avoid to achieve because thinking is hard when you are hurt. 
                        Acceptance and understanding, will make you Happy because you are altruistic and seek knowledge in both depth, breadth and syncretism like a true polymath. Joy is  simply an emotion , the same way sadness is an emotion but 
                        depression is a State. It will come and go, you cannot rely on this to be a consistent safety net or baseline. It can be induced by drugs and life circumstances or events. I want Happy. I am guilty of everything I preach a 
                        person ought not to be. It’s unfortunate I feel like as I live I have so little control over myself, like the principles of sufficient reason is true and that I have no liberum arbitrium, I am a slave to circumstance and my 
                        own inborn characteristics, but it doesn’t mean I won’t strive to become Happy. There are steps to become. Mainly from a quite poignant conversation I had with my eye doctor. In short, he said that old people are like time 
                        capsules that can tell you Valuable information about what you shouldn’t do and should do and that true altruism is a necessary antecedent to Happy. I had a cool birding trip today, overwhelmed by all the new species that were
                            introduced to be and had no time to digest them haha. Got some photos and saw some sandpipers for the first time although they were not the spotted sandpipers that like to shake their butt. They were mainly least sandpipers 
                            and western sandpipers and one solitary larger shorebird whose name I can’t remember. Great people and very perspicacious bird guide. Bird watching is indeed a very technical skill that requires a lot of semantic knowledge 
                            and learned observational skills from experience. Acute awareness and patience is absolutely key. In a tearful and heavily familially sentimental light, I recently have been thinking about my Father, my Mother especially my
                            sophomore year during finals week, and my grandmother and I have gotten into very morbid and depressed mood. Mainly stemming from a sense of profound ineffable gratitude and guilt that they had to work this hard and not 
                            receive what they deserved from me, a rejection and complete apathy about their love and effort on their part from me. Bob just called, and since we last spoke two hours ago I’ve experienced the full spectrum of humanemotion.
                    Computers are only capable of 0 and 1s yeses and nos but no multifacility,  so we give them numbers.
                    Everything that is possible or could be willed has an urge to exist. Will it?

                    There seems to be a murder of crows that frequent my apartment complex. Right before,perchance everyday, they fly en mass and create a spectacular view in the sky.
                    <br><br>
                    At this point of my life, the same visceral emotional and motivational and disciplinary problems recur and I suffer from them, accept and understand, albeit shamefully, 
                    why I am feeling these emtotions, accept them albeit not very self-lovingly, attempt to develop resolutions or at the veryy least coping mechanisms for them but end up 
                    remaining in a very painful but familar depression that keeps cycling. At this point I am angry and the worst part is that it is nobody's fault but mine, but I have a
                     tendency to export my anger to someone else, something I did to my father last year although he may have deserved it, and something I am doing to someone right now 
                     although to a lesser degree and someone that definitel does not deserve it. I am in pain, but i cannot control myself, and the gap between feeling and response is small,
                      leading to explosive and self destructive behavior. The desperation makes me act out, makes me take out the thoguhts of wanting to just escape this beautiful world and
                       put it towards anger. I want to escape, but its strong, but I have a lot of things that I love to do and that make me have a awe-full child like wonder that really

                          There seems to be a murder of crows that frequent my apartment complex. Right before,perchance everyday, they fly en mass and create a spectacular view in the sky.

                            At this point of my life, the same visceral emotional and motivational and disciplinary problems recur and I suffer from them, accept and understand, albeit shamfully, 
                            why I am feeling these emtotions, accept them albeit not very self-lovingly, attempt to develop resolutions or at the veryy least coping mechanisms for them but end up
                             remaining in a very painful but familar depression that keeps cycling. At this point I am angry and the worst part is that it is nobody's fault but mine, but I have a
                              tendency to export my anger to someone else, something I did to my father last year although he may have deserved it, and something I am doing to someone right now 
                              although to a lesser degree and someone that definitel does not deserve it. I am in pain, but i cannot control myself, and the gap between feeling and response is 
                              small, leading to explosive and self destructive behavior. The desperation makes me act out, makes me take out the thoguhts of wanting to just escape this beautiful
                               world and put it towards anger. I want to escape, but its strong, but I have a lot of things that I love to do and that make me have a awe-full child like wonder
                                that really revivitilizes m will to live. Its not her fault, I know that, Its a problem with my own internal expectations and needs that i am not entitled to and

                                cruel. But i am selfish and i am cruel. I am a terrible person with instability. I want this cycle of pain to end, the only way is two fold: external or internal.

                    Higher order universal moral principles does not rule over my immediate primitive subjective reality. I have no capacity for counter factual thinking sometimes . My brain needs to be stimulated but at the right amount .



                    Since we can never have an intimate understanding of the thing in of itself, we emulate them. We can never understand it in its numenom so we emulate it in our cultural curio like art, music, video games, and literature. Humans like to reflect what we see in our life and our impressions on things into our creations and expressions.







                    As C increases there is less regularization strength so there is higher pixel values and brightness, this Is inversely true for when it is smaller which means regularization strength is higher



                    What the fuck is wrong with me? Serious question . Why do I engage in self destructive behavior ? Why do I hurt so many other people. I was on a phone call with my mother yesterday. I lied to her saying I was sick and I could not attend my sisters birthday. She was telling me to be careful, drink water, asking me how I felt, and her little but not very succinct soliloquy about taking care of myself. I cried very hard .



                    I’m laying in bed right now. I’m probobly gonna take a 10m Power Nap then go take a cold shower and start day drinking while writing commentary and watching programs. I would do my ProLog homework but, all I can say is Parkinson’s law haha. 



                    I am at the perfect equilibrium on the Yerkes Dodson curve at the constant failure rate on the bathtub curve                    

                    Eclectic neighborhood of Nilan, each house has thei own little expression of the persons interest . Those who aren’t bound to society tend to fall here. Here we see a sad decline, from a thriving tourist site for regattas and lake side oasis homes to a toxic wasteland with large dust bowls that carry lethal chemicals from the dried up lakebed such as selenium and arsenic. My girlfriend and I could smell the disgusting rotten egg hydrogen sulfide even 8 miles out from the lake at salvation mountain. The water is not amenable to life, it’s few fish that are left are struggling to survive such as the desert pupfish and the talapia. The water has a staggeringly low oxygen level due to decomposing algae and bacteria, and since it’s a terminal lake, it does not get fed any new water which means the lake is becoming even more saline. Birds and local wildlife are either leaving  or dying of  botulism due to eating infected fish, and an area once used for jet skiiing and water skiing is almost as barren as Titans Ethan and methane oceans. It all started when a wealthy property owner decided to pull the plug in local development in the 60s, along with tropical storms that destroyed resorts in the 70s, the area experienced economic decline.  It was once called Lake Cahuilla, supplied by the Colorado River who eventually dried up once the River diverted its course.



                    Ppl here are living their own untied lives, selling jewelry they scavenged, art curio they created.



                    Here’s some pics of Coachella valley, imperial valley and Salton sea area : 



                    Went rock climbing at presumable wet toes rock problem. Climbed up the pretty grippy limestone formation. As I climbed up I heard someone say “Ariba” turns out there were 3 fisherman on the peak of the promontory looking down at me when I was peaking up the cliff side. I managed to get two good hand holds and a right foot hold and hoisted myself up. I’m imagining myself in their shoes, fishing peacefully and out of nowhere u see a head pop up from the cliff side . It’s an awsome feeling, being a circus act and doing something dangerous for everyone to see. I had a conversation with them . An animal died here last season or at least when they were last since here because there were flowers blooming. As I went down to the base of the rock a woman shouted “good job” . She saw me climb a rather dangerous and steep rock. Dangerous , a fall will kill you. Met a bunch of ppl with crash pads . They were chill.



                    Stoney point is the quintessential sandstone rock formation found in the Simi hills consisting of low rocky outcropping from the upper Cretaceous period formed by turbidity currents 65 million years ago. We came here to climb some rocks. We were able to scale some smaller problems. Extremely exhilarating being in the middle of the beta and having to commit because falling would be too high and climbing down would be difficult. Climbing and finding the right hand holds and foot holds breathing heavily, calming yourself and being the state of flow to think about foot placement, body position , and technique to preserve your energy and prevent attrition to your arms, it’s all FUN. There was a 20ft sandstone rock at the base of Stoney point, I managed to get 1/3 up and saw a great hand hold and food hold but it was too high off the ground. I had my first mental block, I was scared , I could die. My plan : do smaller problems because larger problems are just a constitution of smaller constituent problems. Amazing formations , this one is called Chatsworth formation. There’s a sense of anxiety and fear when looking for the next technical decision, but this struggle makes me feel free, freedom to traverse paths that strangle you , paths that seems impossible to summit. These are small mountains, i feel like I’m, not so much imposing myself onto the rock but understanding it and maneuvering myself around it. Almost as if I’m having a conversation trying to decide what is the next sentence I will say. It feels nice because once you understand the personality of this rock, you feel comfortable and thus free! Freedom to climb because of experience and knowledge !!! Freedom because I KNOW and UNDERSTAND the movements that is conducive of a successful climb. Fluidity of movement, being like water, going wherever it is the path of least resistance, it’s the state of the flow in a dangerous environment 





                    ————



                    Things die, all things end. We look at this temporality. Life is a long experiment , or project, and with any project there are tradeoffs. Things that we are willing to lose, knowing full well what we lost. We may not like it but we cannot bare living any other way.



                    I just Did a V3 today with a pretty scary smear send move to a jug to finish it off with a down facing right hand hold. The beta for the beginning bottom half is quite tricky as it requires a use of a volume, left leg push against the volume and right hand reach to clench the opposite side of the volume so u can use ur right hand and continue the climb. The send was scary ! But the one thing that convinced me was that it isn’t as high as I thought . The fall is only as tall as my feet are high, it only appears tall because my noggin is 68 jnches higher than the fall would be haha.

                    The morro bay bridging festival has been a stellar success in almost every regard in terms of bird metrics and human amenability/ agreeableness. I don’t have the mental capacity for prose so I’ll simply enumerate the reasons:

                    -spotted 2 long tailed ducks which usually winter in morro bay once every 3 years give or take

                    -two great horned owls spotted on eucalyptus in sweet springs one male and one female. Usually this is not mating season and we don’t see owls usually in dusk. We saw their mating process where the male gets on top of the female and rapidly flaps his wings, a rare and beautiful and an avian voyeur’s wet dream. 

                    -a nesting burrowing owl in morro bay rock, along with two paraguine falcons

                    -king fisher spotted on a cruise with an ostensible good mood due to his high tolerance to humans today

                    -flying barns owls 

                    -leopard shark spotted while kayaking 

                    -sweet springs at dusk feels like I’m on proxima centari c

                    Horrific dreams. But it was the air that was suffocating, I was always anxious and at the verge of an angry outburst . It showed me my fathers love but cold indifference or the lack of parental care towards my feelings, my mothers unjudicious tirades, and my love for my siblings. If there were a story it may be my father getting a security clearance and I had to leave as soon as possible. But I had to come back to get my brother. I was looking at old photos of me. I felt like my potential was gone.

                    I had terrible sleep where my dreams where a frenzied mess, comprised on a hot disgusting soup of my superficial anxieties, the fleeing from necessity. Tossing and Turning
                    I felt like there was bugs or something crawling all  over my skin. This followed tumult yesterday, perhaps one of the most difficult and spiritually depraved days of recent memory,
                    alone and wanting to escape my the own horror I have built for myself. A Horror I was not able to contain, which previously had hurt people who did not deserve such treatment. I am bitter, 
                    I am jelous because although over the years my self conception has conjured some semblance of integrity much more, with the humanistic asthetic focus towards the self, more 
                    resolve, the enjoyment of solitude, the understanding of what makes me ME, what makes me a unique entity that is beautiful, there is a part of my ego that feels that I am disadvantaged, that I am
                    different in the unfavorable cardinal direction. And whereof I have this sense of self pity and loath, Ive built a defense of thinking I deserve better yet I do not, I create the preconditons for 
                    what I hate. I presuppose what I am trying to rid. I am creating my own suffering. Thinking I deserve better, thinking because of this I am wasted potential, and there because depression is the 
                    definition of the abscence of possibility, I am depressed. The amalagm of depression and bitterness created by this despair of spiritual depravity, has gotten me to act rashly, yet become more poetic.
                    I need to take out my anger and at the wrong innocent people many times. Because I am jeleous that someone else had the oppourtunity to live life more than me, that their spirit was able to live for more Life
                    than I was, and that therefore there was something intrisically aversive about me. But this all my own doing, ive hurt others and hurt myself and Ive been too self absorbed to notice. Ive tried to observe 
                    my feelings and yet i end up absorbing them. There were many times not just yesterday where I have prospected about my life, and this deep sense of dread hits me everytime, of existential sickness, of the gravity
                    of futility and meaninglessness, one that is of a primal intuitive nature rather than a rational one. Ive come to terms with my life, that because I am an asthetic man in the kierkegaardian sense that I will 
                    always never achieve the state of peaceful altruism. I will always be chasing something, I will always need to be drunk with passion. Perhaps the most elequent and tasteful decision I can make henceforth is to killmyself.

                <p>
                    Whether you cry or remain silent it’s all the same . It’s absurd . But why not embrace the suffering that brings the darkest most ineffable stream of consciousness that can only be described in poetics. 
                    Perhaps it’s not what I can find but I can give to this world . Maybe I will achieve  Eudaimonia, but only the pain will grow and strength the self pitiful spirit of mine. 
                    There’s a profound desperation, an unmet need, a need that I’ve subconsciously rejected and caused great draconian harm through a veil of confusion, its self honesty. This entails accepting the truth,
                     seeking understanding of the self and the relation of the self to itself, and being vulnerable, regardless of the lack of judgment. The ability to be truthful about myself and not feel ashamed. I know I need this parental rescue, to save me from my own trauma, yet I myself subconsciously prevent that. I know I need this emotional rescue, yet a large part of me refuses this. Perhaps though the verbal deprecation, constant ad nauseum deprecation, destruction and annihilation of any semblance of a healthy self esteem , and thus a weak and explosive ego. A great father yet a very abscent one emotionally, who constantly punished the expression of my emotions. I run away from truthful expression, and I need help. I try to seek this, yet I avoid it, I need help and someone to save me, someone I can be vulnerable to. This is why I seek empthagens , I need an escape from this web of self hatred, this engrained recalcitrance to vulnerability. I need help. And I am lonely.

                    I have recently been in a state of confusion regarding myself . Why I feel these emotions , and how to transmute my depression into creative poetry. How do I transmute ? Is pain a driving force ? 
                    Is it this pain that allows me to seek for inspiration ? I don’t think it works this way. I need a channel , a path of least resistance. I am in pain and I want to break the dam that is preventing me from expressing this . I can code , but this requires intellectual cerebral and cognitive fortitude , cerebral because it must be amicable to my nature. Depression inhibits this but stimulants can help. I must find this transmutation, because the world rejects me , and I reject the world at times, I am not and cannot be loved and it is quite clear I am undesirable. This depression will not go away, I am convinced this is inherent in my being, heavily influenced by the way the world perceives me, misunderstands me . I feel I am jealous, and angry that I am missing out, and I pity myself. Is there a rational justification for suicide. I think I have already proved to myself there are manifold. But I have never proved any spiritual and ethical justifications.

                    And there some things I don’t dare to write down even in private , an energy I’ve adulterated with ire and jealousy, of great isolation and self loathing of the highest depravity , 
                    that leads to the attachment to others experiences as a reflection of my own ego and self worth which I see as a potential expression of my value . Extreme adulteration of this taboo energy, 
                    that I want to rip my hair out , because I want to be a part of this world so badly, yet I feel like it never accepts. I feel a sense of great physical pain in my stomache whenever I am reminded 
                    of this aspect of life, because of the aforementioned attachment to another’s experience as a reflection of my own self worth due to the diametrical lack of similar experiences from my own life, 
                    is the best I can describe this very potent but shameful experience. 

                    The disappointment from the world I have felt has turned towards myself, and now I have been unbearable . I have everything wrong with you, but I know it’s unfair , and it’s much more morally 
                    and ethically bearable to hate myself than to hate you.

                  I am going to Taiwan in 21 days, no plan, just one girl I hope I can meet with to save me from being homeless for 2 weeks for the excursion. But i realized Jane is the most amazing Woman 
                  I have ever met in my life (I dont meet my family, blood is thicker than water I dont come across them I am descended from them). I know I may come across rather cold and indifferent,  
                  unrequited emtional labor, although I am not obligated to give that to her, I feel great anguish that this relationship could not work, she just wanted to be happy, shes a girl with simple
                  pleasures, pleasures that reflect what she truely loves and only her, she is so true to herself. She does see my apathy and sometimes cruelty, and I am afraid to express this to her for some 
                  odd reason, perhaps of all the self inflicted pain I put on myself, a reaction to her, but percipitated by own disrelation. But I feel so strongly about her character.
