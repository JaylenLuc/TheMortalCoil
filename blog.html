                <p>liberum arbitrium indiff erentiae is a latin term that explicates the idea of "Free Will" in the idealistic, unadulterated sense
                    both assumed in the metaphysical and phenomonological form. We think of free will as the power of choice, the agency to make 
                    conscious and emphatically autonomous decisions. The power of choice is the power to determine a phenomological outcome, through
                    the control of your metaphysical form. However, I believe the pure indifferent arbitrary liberty in the strictly metaphysical sense
                    does not exist and cannot exist. So heres the logical control flow (premise -> intermediate conclusion -> main conclusion)
