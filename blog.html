                <p> For the fuck of it, imma try to argue that "free will" in its purest form does not exist. It is merely incidental, motivations which are
                    the drivers of free will are incidental, and that all actions of ostensible free will are the only possible action,
                    you "will" only one definite thing and none other. 
                    liberum arbitrium indiff erentiae is a latin term that explicates the idea of "Free Will" in the idealistic, unadulterated sense
                    both assumed in the metaphysical and phenomonological form. We think of free will as the power of choice, the agency to make 
                    conscious and emphatically autonomous decisions. The power of choice is the power to determine a phenomological outcome, through
                    the control of your metaphysical form. However, I believe the pure indifferent arbitrary liberty in the strictly metaphysical sense
                    does not exist and cannot exist. So heres the logical control flow (premise &lt===> warrant (includes link between the claim or
                    conclusion and the premise) &lt===> intermediate conclusion ==> main conclusion). The premise is that the crux of human free will 
                    is predicated on motivation, the capacity for choice. Motives can be caused by extenral stimuli that passes through the knowing mind
                    and/or by abstract concepts and the will to think thoughts. Motivation is simply a game of incidental weighing of many abtract Motives.
                    The Strongest one prevails given the circumstance. In this case, humans are not entirely confined to the present objects causation. But
                    Arthur Schopenhauer posited "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can will only one definite thing and absolutely
                    nothing other than that one thing." If you were to have made a decision that was different, you yourself, your character, must be entirely different which
                    is a rediculous hypothetical. "[M]an does at all times only what he wills, and yet he does this necessarily. But this is because he already is what he wills.".
                    We try try hard to believe in transcendental will as the thing-in-itself because it feels liberating. It is the inner essence of the self aware being. This "will"
                    does exist, but this "free will" is determined by motivations. If water could speak, it may will itself to flow down an estuary, or flow down a cavern. It can will
                    this, but there must be a causation, a motive for this to happen. Every action is preceded by a "will", but this "will" is only rendered active by a motive. And are these
                    motives absolutely arbitrated by us? Our conscious brains are just catching up to what our unconscious brains wer already doing, willing, motivating. it is scary. But we
                    hold on to this transcendental "will", because it is comfortable, because we like knowing, we like control. Just take the Standford Prison experiment done by
                    Phillip Zimbardo which to his construction of his Theory The Lucifer Effect which consists of :  Mindlessly taking the first small step. -> Dehumanization of others.
                    ->De-individuation of self (anonymity)
                    ->Diffusion of personal responsibility.
                    ->Blind obedience to authority.
                    ->Uncritical conformity to group norms.
                    ->Passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference. All this is done without conscious knowledge by humans. Humans blindly conforming to an evil system, rendering
                    us complacent to committing evil acts with impunity and with no remorse. If we have free will we must be judged by our motives that motivate our will to render an action, what
                    where the motives of these other wise "good" people in the observed world. These motives were unconcious, inborn, and constant! The proxy for free will is taking
                    responsibility for ones actions, can you hold someone accountable for unconcious acts? Therefore there is no moral freedom, and thus can there really be responsibility
                    assigned? One indicator for free will is accountability for ones actions, responsibility, and awareness. This is because we live under the assumption that motives 
                    are chosen by our will and our will wills this motive. But can we really say there is accountability there? (see "voodoo doll experiment") "In effect, the unconscious brain proposes and the mind disposes."
                    Our conscious minds only has the power to veto the policies and proposals of the unconcious mind. Can we really call that free will if we cannot consiously determine what we will
                    and what motivates action? We can supress and control, but acts of proscription is an indication of a hasty and frantic attempt to control the uncontrollable.

                <p>Being able to monkey around urban apparatuses confers a special quality of liberty and wakefullness. I feel more in tune with my environment
                    and my body. I think this is engendered by the fact that with the ability to be able to climb, my physical footprint (and handprint so to speak)
                    is expanded and the world seems so accessible to me. I see urbano around me and it doesnt look so scary anymore, I can father this structure, I can 
                    interact with the building interface and move by body without fear. The freedom to move where ever i want is exhilerating and liberating. Becuase the closer
                    you get to a stright line is the shortest path to your destination. I can see urbano and it not be an impediment to me but an enabler, because I am now 
                    an agent of my own destiny!
