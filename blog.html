                <p> For the fuck of it, imma try to argue that "free will" in its purest form does not exist. It is merely incidental, motivations which are
                    the drivers of free will are incidental, and that all actions of ostensible free will are the only possible action,
                    you "will" only one definite thing and none other. 
                    liberum arbitrium indiff erentiae is a latin term that explicates the idea of "Free Will" in the idealistic, unadulterated sense
                    both assumed in the metaphysical and phenomonological form. We think of free will as the power of choice, the agency to make 
                    conscious and emphatically autonomous decisions. The power of choice is the power to determine a phenomological outcome, through
                    the control of your metaphysical form. However, I believe the pure indifferent arbitrary liberty in the strictly metaphysical sense
                    does not exist and cannot exist. So heres the logical control flow (premise &lt===> warrant (includes link between the claim or
                    conclusion and the premise) &lt===> intermediate conclusion ==> main conclusion). The premise is that the crux of human free will 
                    is predicated on motivation, the capacity for choice. Motives can be caused by extenral stimuli that passes through the knowing mind
                    and/or by abstract concepts and the will to think thoughts. Motivation is simply a game of incidental weighing of many abtract Motives.
                    The Strongest one prevails given the circumstance. In this case, humans are not entirely confined to the present objects causation. But
                    Arthur Schopenhauer posited "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can will only one definite thing and absolutely
                    nothing other than that one thing." If you were to have made a decision that was different, you yourself, your character, must be entirely different which
                    is a rediculous hypothetical. "[M]an does at all times only what he wills, and yet he does this necessarily. But this is because he already is what he wills.".
                    We try try hard to believe in transcendental will as the thing-in-itself because it feels liberating. It is the inner essence of the self aware being. This "will"
                    does exist, but this "free will" is determined by motivations. If water could speak, it may will itself to flow down an estuary, or flow down a cavern. It can will
                    this, but there must be a causation, a motive for this to happen. Every action is preceded by a "will", but this "will" is only rendered active by a motive. And are these
                    motives absolutely arbitrated by us? Our conscious brains are just catching up to what our unconscious brains wer already doing, willing, motivating. it is scary. But we
                    hold on to this transcendental "will", because it is comfortable, because we like knowing, we like control. Just take the Standford Prison experiment done by
                    Phillip Zimbardo which to his construction of his Theory The Lucifer Effect which consists of :  Mindlessly taking the first small step. -> Dehumanization of others.
                    ->De-individuation of self (anonymity)
                    ->Diffusion of personal responsibility.
                    ->Blind obedience to authority.
                    ->Uncritical conformity to group norms.
                    ->Passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference. All this is done without conscious knowledge by humans. Humans blindly conforming to an evil system, rendering
                    us complacent to committing evil acts with impunity and with no remorse. If we have free will we must be judged by our motives that motivate our will to render an action, what
                    where the motives of these other wise "good" people in the observed world. These motives were unconcious, inborn, and constant! The proxy for free will is taking
                    responsibility for ones actions, can you hold someone accountable for unconcious acts? Therefore there is no moral freedom, and thus can there really be responsibility
                    assigned? One indicator for free will is accountability for ones actions, responsibility, and awareness. This is because we live under the assumption that motives 
                    are chosen by our will and our will wills this motive. But can we really say there is accountability there? (see "voodoo doll experiment") "In effect, the unconscious brain proposes and the mind disposes."
                    Our conscious minds only has the power to veto the policies and proposals of the unconcious mind. Can we really call that free will if we cannot consiously determine what we will
                    and what motivates action? We can supress and control, but acts of proscription is an indication of a hasty and frantic attempt to control the uncontrollable.

                <a id="climbing"><h2 style="text-align:center">Rock Climbing and exploring Urbano</h2></a>
                <p>Being able to monkey around urban apparatuses confers a special quality of liberty and wakefullness. I feel more in tune with my environment
                    and my body. I think this is engendered by the fact that with the ability to be able to climb, my physical footprint (and handprint so to speak)
                    is expanded and the world seems so accessible to me. I see urbano around me and it doesnt look so scary anymore, I can father this structure, I can 
                    interact with the building interface and move by body without fear. The freedom to move where ever i want is exhilerating and liberating. Becuase the closer
                    you get to a stright line is the shortest path to your destination. I can see urbano and it not be an impediment to me but an enabler, because I am now 
                    an agent of my own destiny! The ability to navigate our surroundings is an important skill. Places that once were designed for regular use, that have fallen
                    from vitality, now abandoned and subject to the whims of unregulated human behavior, and the whims of unvetoed natural forces is one kind of 
                    urbano mileu, a surrounding, a space in time that I enjoy. It gives me the same thrill and simultaneous peace as climbing, and many times you need
                    to climb to access these places. I feel free, free from my own suffering that I created or maybe not. The tranquil chaos is how i describe it.
                    When my mind is in a mess, i search for places that match my energy but provide an equal but opposite attracting force. Its dangerous, scary, but
                    I can escape because I "will" it and for a mutlitude of reasons that "will" is motivated by forces in my mind i cannot control. is it the "will" that 
                    creates the motive or the motive that creates the will or is it that the "will" always exists but awaits contigently and incidentally for a motive to 
                    strike it !!!!!???? I hate myself and I sometimes love myself, I have this churning knot in my stoamch and I cease to be "doing", but when I am in These
                    places, I feel like I have achieved escpae velocity of my mind. AHHHHHH. In this way, I feel liberated and in tune with me, like when I climb. My life is 
                    at risk, and I Love it. Buildings like these are in the limbo of anthropogenic urbano, and it stimulates me, when my mind is desperate I see these 
                    places reach a parity with me .

                <a id="winetasting"><h2 style="text-align:center">Orange Gold and Gulfi Nerojbleo</h2></a>
                <p>like a child in a candy store, me and my friend yacob strolled through the winery -- The Original Winery mind you (all wineries have awsome employee polos for some reason. and yes 
                    "for some reason" because every thing has a reason. However, they never sell them to customers, kind of a missed bussiness oppourtunity) excited but tired after going rock climbing And
                    bouldering (where I finally got my belaying certification). We eventually came out with 4 wines in total, two of which i purchased and the same two I will express my thoughts on.
                    So i popped open the orange wine. Orange wines are the biracial kind of wine, they are made from the white grape variant called pinot grigio of the species Vitis vinifera which is 
                    taxonomically lower in its specificity than species. The process involves the use of keeping both the seeds and skin, a decision usually taken when making red wine. The taste is interesting: 
                    its very dry and acidic and almost tastes like a suagry soda drink wtih some vodka poured into it. meh meh.  Gulfi Nerojbleo is a red wine from Sicily, Italy. It's made from Nero d'Avola grapes
                    which is full bodied, jammy fruit, and sweet tannins. Nero d'Avola is a dry wine with lower acidity and considered the "the most important red wine grape in Sicily". What I taste is a very
                    full bodied, peppery falvour, and a bit dry. And I might say that there are even hints of fruit in the falvour finerprint as well. Almost as if im back in seattle picking berries off old dilapitated 
                    walkways, abandoned urbano of all kinds, and a rustic busheries near a nice stream which may be contaminated by brewery effluent leading to a depletion of oxygen in the water, and increased
                    sodium concentrations. It tastes good. Life is Good, but I make my life Bad somehow, its the will, its the Representation... So It Goes i guess....

                <a id="albumreview1"><h2 style="text-align:center">Album review: the now now and never by what is your name?</h2></a>
                <p>
                    <p><img class= "center" src="pictures\nonow.jpg" alt="girlfriend" style="width:30%" onclick="window.open('pictures\\nonow.jpg', '_blank')">
                    It seems like this artist is a self made, individual producer that takes samples and sounds and composes sonic collages. Its a certain vibe that even they can’t describe. Started off 
                    With break core, they now have walked into a path that is more revitalizing. I do not know what to call this new sound scape.Perhaps plunder phonics? But that term is a bit radical and pejorative, perhaps
                    a sound collage with a synthesis of indietroncis, post rock, breakcore, shoe gaze, shoe gazing, gazing at a shoe, and a whole lot of awesome!
                    I came across a very comforting and refreshing artist when a friend decided to send me a song from an artist anointed the name ‘what is your name?’ even
                    Suffixed with a question mark as if it is asking you for you name? The music wants to know who you are, wrap its sonic vibrations around you and comfort you unconditionally.
                    I find that these songs define a subset of human emotion that I was trying to find, a certain sound I was try to hear. I want it but I can never find it, a warmth and reprieve 
                    I need in my life whether I deserve it or not. It defines this very sentimental, emotive, bitter sweet whimsical happiness. Listening to this album feels like I am rediscovering 
                    my childlike Wonder, rediscovering the word that is within my own headspace and as a result seeing the world in a light that is a little bit different, almost a different hue. I 
                    feel Melancholic, I got the Morbs. These type of songs and music are hard to describe, it just feels like stepping back into your childhood room, surrounded by color, cultural curio, 
                    memories. It gives me a similar feeling to when I listen to passion pit, you step into a world of calm. My visceral unconscious brain likes to take my cognitive conscious self for a little walk.
                    Sometimes it kidnaps my conscious self and my consciousness has to play a very frantic and stressful catch up game with my unconscious essence.
                    But with these songs, my unconscious self is pleasant, not amicable or philanthropic, just simply behaving in a way that I trust and treading the roads in a consistent way. It takes me to a
                    place that I like this time, unlike other times. It takes me to a place, a road, maybe leading nowhere. It is Dusk, the suns light was just hidden under the horizon, only some of its vigor is left
                    creating a dark blue hue that engulfs the sky. It takes me across this road, and its warm. I might be by myself? I am walking, with no purpose, no reason, just warmth, but with a little bit of desperation,
                    the source of which is the very thing that took me to this place. What a life! As the mortal coil unwinds, we cannot do anything about it, so maybe… let the wind carry us. I am moving, I am crying and I
                        am morb bombed. So it goes. This album is a strata of the human condition that deals with desperation mixed with morbination and depression and melancholia. You want to die but you don’t, you feel,
                        YOU FEEL! You realize that often times, the fundamental principles of sufficient reasoning and lack of free will makes you ill, weak, sick with disease. From the depths of you unconscious it strangles 
                        you, expect you don’t die, you are dead but you are alive and you are condemned to live like this, suffering everyday, wanting to get out of your cage. And you realize that, as stoics would posit, you
                        create much of you suffering, as much or even more than external vicissitudes , and you create situations and emotive cages from your own brain, alot of the times you cannot control and alot of the
                        time is a positive feedback loop that is necessitated from your inner darkest subconscious. EVIL and CRUEL THIS IS CRUELLLLLLLL!!!!!!!

                    Anyways I like this album, makes me feel…. But I just let it carry me.

                    I give this album 2 and half full leaf sheeps

                <p>
                as long as we are humans with fragile bodies, streaming minds, and a yearning for love, romance, meaning , purpose, as long as there is a mysterious spontaneous universe, and as long as there is this cruel, unforgiving , unloving, meaningless, 
                purposeless and self directed world, I will be eternally feeling worthless , confused, confusing, angry, and ineffably miserable. It’s quite absurd. Absurdist . Like the word absurdist boy pussy. I like that word. Worldly responsibilities hold an 
                iron fist around these spirits of ours . We often structure our thoughts around a world we want, not the world as a noumenon. There’s a gulf of execution, gulf of evaluation that drives me to the brink of wanted to leave this world. Maybe doing 
                things like this would give me a small inlet for my mind to enjoy some peace, some joy. But the tides keep flowing . I stand alone, alone in my own life. This is my way of expressing what I find somewhat peaceful . No more and no less.
                 Whether I start to over intellectualize a trivial hobby is a question for the future. Go to a secluded area by myself, smoke some weed, and maybe I’ll be more detached from egoist and emotional resistances , pressures. Maybe I’ll feel better. Maybe I’ll love myself.

                    Preface: At first this entry was going to be just about my friend Bob, but I interjected it with other things I was Feeling, so it’ll just be a free style impromptu journal entry that has no particular direction but a lot of flavor.
                    <br><br>
                    My dear friend bob. One and a trillion chance you will be born from conception just to be named bob haha. I’m kidding, love you bob. Everytime I feel like a certain kind of languish and lassitude , 
                    I hit this boy up and we end up having the best most intellectually stimulating conversations. It makes me think that a person like me needs someone by my side to be ready just to listen and engage with me. 
                    I feel energized when I converse with him, because I get this child like wonder I felt like I was temporarily missing up until that point. We could talking about anything from urban planning, roadway traffic analysis, 
                    neo platonic monism, and just recently about how it’s strange how the same very primitive human brain can create a society has moved past and beyond certain primal needs of human beings. Recently I went bouldering, 
                    I got tired very easily and rather quickly which sucked and I was dissatisfied that I couldn’t go any further, but now everytime I laugh my entire upper body hurts. Anyways, I always enjoy my time with bob, I want to
                    keep learning, exposing myself to new ideas and thoughts and feelings I thought never existed, I want to keep reading so I can keep having these conversations with him. They really keep me going, it’s these interactions 
                    that keep me loving my life at certain points. At times I think I will never meet a person like him, but then again, will I ever meet anyone like everyone I know? Everyone is so unique, whether I enjoy my time with them or not. 
                    I feel so bad I hurt my girlfriend, I feel like if things were to end soon, I will never find anyone like her ever again, someone that is so idiosyncratic and pulchritudinous. She becomes more beautiful and impressive the more
                    I know her and spend time with her, she just becomes so much more like an individual I want to spend my life with. Currently she’s my betrothed wife but I want to take care of her and love her, and make her experience the joys in life.
                    I hurt her many times because of thought processes that spiral me into uncontrollably draconian moods, I wish I never become that persons ever again. Certain images in my head come to mind that destroy me but also reassure me,
                        I need to love her and care for her. I want to make her proud, and I want her to be safe and achieve Happy (not a typo). Because there’s a difference between the state of Happy and the feeling of joy. Happy is a consistent and
                        reliable baseline, a state of being and existing and thinking. Happy is achieved through hard introspection and self development, and a hard rewriting of your thinking and feeling processes which may be near impossible if
                        you are Me. You will experience turbulence but you will rebound to the Happy. You will spread this warmth and passion to the world. It is consistency, an internal state that creates a sense of security that makes you an 
                        individual agent that is almost seperate from its environment but learns to Accept and understand their lot, not create defense mechanism to create a false sense of joy and therefore boost their own ego at the expense of
                        their own long term mental health and the so called ontological truth which is the subjective conclusion a critically thinking individual would conclude and not simply avoid to achieve because thinking is hard when you are hurt. 
                        Acceptance and understanding, will make you Happy because you are altruistic and seek knowledge in both depth, breadth and syncretism like a true polymath. Joy is  simply an emotion , the same way sadness is an emotion but 
                        depression is a State. It will come and go, you cannot rely on this to be a consistent safety net or baseline. It can be induced by drugs and life circumstances or events. I want Happy. I am guilty of everything I preach a 
                        person ought not to be. It’s unfortunate I feel like as I live I have so little control over myself, like the principles of sufficient reason is true and that I have no liberum arbitrium, I am a slave to circumstance and my 
                        own inborn characteristics, but it doesn’t mean I won’t strive to become Happy. There are steps to become. Mainly from a quite poignant conversation I had with my eye doctor. In short, he said that old people are like time 
                        capsules that can tell you Valuable information about what you shouldn’t do and should do and that true altruism is a necessary antecedent to Happy. I had a cool birding trip today, overwhelmed by all the new species that were
                            introduced to be and had no time to digest them haha. Got some photos and saw some sandpipers for the first time although they were not the spotted sandpipers that like to shake their butt. They were mainly least sandpipers 
                            and western sandpipers and one solitary larger shorebird whose name I can’t remember. Great people and very perspicacious bird guide. Bird watching is indeed a very technical skill that requires a lot of semantic knowledge 
                            and learned observational skills from experience. Acute awareness and patience is absolutely key. In a tearful and heavily familially sentimental light, I recently have been thinking about my Father, my Mother especially my
                            sophomore year during finals week, and my grandmother and I have gotten into very morbid and depressed mood. Mainly stemming from a sense of profound ineffable gratitude and guilt that they had to work this hard and not 
                            receive what they deserved from me, a rejection and complete apathy about their love and effort on their part from me. Bob just called, and since we last spoke two hours ago I’ve experienced the full spectrum of humanemotion.
                    Computers are only capable of 0 and 1s yeses and nos but no multifacility,  so we give them numbers.
                    Everything that is possible or could be willed has an urge to exist. Will it?

                    There seems to be a murder of crows that frequent my apartment complex. Right before,perchance everyday, they fly en mass and create a spectacular view in the sky.
                    <br><br>
                    At this point of my life, the same visceral emotional and motivational and disciplinary problems recur and I suffer from them, accept and understand, albeit shamefully, 
                    why I am feeling these emtotions, accept them albeit not very self-lovingly, attempt to develop resolutions or at the veryy least coping mechanisms for them but end up 
                    remaining in a very painful but familar depression that keeps cycling. At this point I am angry and the worst part is that it is nobody's fault but mine, but I have a
                     tendency to export my anger to someone else, something I did to my father last year although he may have deserved it, and something I am doing to someone right now 
                     although to a lesser degree and someone that definitel does not deserve it. I am in pain, but i cannot control myself, and the gap between feeling and response is small,
                      leading to explosive and self destructive behavior. The desperation makes me act out, makes me take out the thoguhts of wanting to just escape this beautiful world and
                       put it towards anger. I want to escape, but its strong, but I have a lot of things that I love to do and that make me have a awe-full child like wonder that really
                        revivitilizes m will to live. Its not her fault, I know that, Its a problem with my own internal expectations and needs that i am not entitled to and an exportation
                         of my frustrations when they arent met. It fucking hurts. But I cannot help but feel like i need to export a form of admonition. Its selfish and cruel. But i am 
                         selfish and i am cruel. I am a terrible person with instability. I want this cycle of pain to end, the only way is two fold: external or internal. Internal change 
                         and acceptance is the hardest but most robust, while external change is probobly not gonna happen and its completely out of our control. I am mad mad mad, at myself

                          There seems to be a murder of crows that frequent my apartment complex. Right before,perchance everyday, they fly en mass and create a spectacular view in the sky.

                            At this point of my life, the same visceral emotional and motivational and disciplinary problems recur and I suffer from them, accept and understand, albeit shamfully, 
                            why I am feeling these emtotions, accept them albeit not very self-lovingly, attempt to develop resolutions or at the veryy least coping mechanisms for them but end up
                             remaining in a very painful but familar depression that keeps cycling. At this point I am angry and the worst part is that it is nobody's fault but mine, but I have a
                              tendency to export my anger to someone else, something I did to my father last year although he may have deserved it, and something I am doing to someone right now 
                              although to a lesser degree and someone that definitel does not deserve it. I am in pain, but i cannot control myself, and the gap between feeling and response is 
                              small, leading to explosive and self destructive behavior. The desperation makes me act out, makes me take out the thoguhts of wanting to just escape this beautiful
                               world and put it towards anger. I want to escape, but its strong, but I have a lot of things that I love to do and that make me have a awe-full child like wonder
                                that really revivitilizes m will to live. Its not her fault, I know that, Its a problem with my own internal expectations and needs that i am not entitled to and

                            the topic of human epistimological objectivity for the neumenon itself, its essence is subject to perennial discussion. In all practically achievable metrics, 
                            an outsider perspective is refreshing.
